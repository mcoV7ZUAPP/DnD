The prison built by the shadow legion is a grim and foreboding place, located deep within the heart of their stronghold. It is a dark and dank place, with thick stone walls and heavy iron bars. The air is damp and stale, and the sound of dripping water echoes through the corridors. The cells are small and cramped, and the prisoners are shackled and chained, with barely enough room to move or breathe.

The heroes are held in this prison, after being captured by the shadow legion on a traveling ship. They are thrown into a cell, and left to languish in the darkness and filth. They are weakened and disoriented, and are unsure of what the shadow legion has planned for them. They must use all of their wits and skills to survive the ordeal, and to find a way to escape from the prison and return to their quest to save the kingdom.
