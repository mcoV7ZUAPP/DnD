The death of the king and the transition to a new ruler may have caused political upheaval and instability. Some nobles and officials may have disputed Queen Elara's right to rule, leading to conflict and unrest.

Lord Reginald: a powerful and ambitious noble who believes that only a man should be allowed to rule the kingdom. He is envious of Queen Elara's position, and seeks to undermine her authority at every turn. He may try to rally other nobles to his cause, and may even plot to overthrow the queen and take the throne for himself.

Lady Isadora: a scheming and manipulative noblewoman who is jealous of Queen Elara's power. She may try to use her influence and connections to spread rumors and lies about the queen, in an attempt to discredit her and weaken her hold on the throne. She may also try to curry favor with other nobles and officials, in the hopes of gaining more power and influence.

Lord Aric: a brave and honorable warrior who believes that Queen Elara is too weak and inexperienced to rule the kingdom. He may openly challenge her decisions, and may even refuse to obey her orders. He may also seek to gain the support of other nobles and military leaders, in the hopes of rallying them to his cause.
