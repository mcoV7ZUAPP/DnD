The tavern in Woodhaven is a cozy and welcoming place, located at the heart of the town. It is a one-story building, with a thatched roof and a sturdy wooden frame. Inside, the tavern is warm and inviting, with a fireplace crackling in the corner and a bar stocked with a variety of ales, wines, and spirits. The tavern is filled with the sounds of laughter, conversation, and clinking glasses, as the locals and travelers gather to socialize and share their stories.

The tavern is a popular gathering place for the heroes of Aldor, who come here to plan their next adventure or to celebrate their latest victory. As they gather around a table, they discuss the rumors of a hostile goblin village that has been terrorizing the local farmers and merchants. The heroes are determined to put an end to the goblin's reign of terror, and they make plans to gather their weapons and gear, and set out to destroy the goblin village. They are eager for the challenge, and are confident in their ability to triumph over the evil that plagues the kingdom.
